I thought that this was a real good idea, something I could use myself. So I immediately started coding it in Code::Blocks.

Because I work on Linux myself I made it working on a Lubuntu system already. I've tried to do much coding in preparation to compile it on Windows but there will be plenty of errors because I do not have a working installation of C::B on Windows. I tried to install it in a virtual machine but even a newly generated project with wxWidgets will not compile free of errors. All help to make this project work in Windows is really appreciated.
